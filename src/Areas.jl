""" Areas:
GOAL:
    - Obtaining all the areas of the triangular mesh elements that have been intercepted by the rays (areas are not projected onto the velocity directions)
        - The rays are originated on a plane which is perpendicular to the velocity vector, and far from the satellite body 
INPUT:
    - rmax            :: radius of the circular plane from where rays originate
    - distance        :: distance at which the circular plane is located (it should be out from the satellite body)
    - dir             :: direction of the oncoming particle
    - triangles       :: vertices coordinates of the triangular/quad mesh element
OUTPUT:
    - OutFacets    :: matrix storing the triangle index, area, and the angle between the normal and the velocity direction
        - Matrix{Float64} -> size: (3, number of intercepted triangles)
    - Aproj           :: projection of the intercepted triangular areas onto the velocity direction 
    - Aref            :: sum of all intercepted triangular areas
